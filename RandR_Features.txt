R&R Database 'Features'

Carrier Table (Sales Order Additional)
=============
Jill tends to delete the carrier record when she prints out the invoices. It would be nice to retain a record of this carrier information. There is the odd case of duplicate records with sequential record numbers. I'm not sure why these are created.
The Carrier field has also been used for miscellaneous comments to be printed on the invoice.
It is also possible for the original carrier to be deleted and a new carrier then added. Although one has been deleted, the new record has a different record number. This means that if a snapshot of the database is taken before the original is deleted and then the database is later syncronised, both records will appear for the same works order.
It may be best to check which records have been deleted before syncing the database.
